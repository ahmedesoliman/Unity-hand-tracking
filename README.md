# Unity-Python hand tracking and gesture recognition application
In this repository I uploaded a personal project that use a combination of python script and C# script to create a Unity application with hand tracking and gesture recognition.
I use a python script to detect the hand movement and the relative gesture.

A simple video demo is aviable at this [link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O4Udf7Gu3zE).

For a more precision and detection see my other project called Hand Tracking Pytorch. You could find the repository on my profile or following this [link](https://github.com/jesus-333/Hand-Tracking-Pytorch).

**NB: THE PROJECT TO WORK NEED SOME FILE THAT I CAN'T UPLOAD ON GITHUB FOR SIZE REASONS.**
The file are available at the following [link](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1doIFMfhjTz7fKd_B_HhHGWr5agNh242I/view?usp=sharing) . Download them an put the in the path specify by the file path extra thing.txt
